Yes.  Yet another arrangement of this favorite hymn.  I've wanted to try this for a while now and recent events have prompted me to give it a go.  This is a fairly easy arrangement, but the melody shifts between Alto and Soprano and should be emphasized by whichever part is carrying it.  I believe the remaining harmonies are somewhat unique among arrangements I have heard.

Written for SATB choir with organ accompaniment.
