Yes. Yet another arrangement of this favorite hymn. I've wanted to try this for a while now and recent events have prompted me to give it a go. This is a fairly easy arrangement, but the melody shifts between Alto and Soprano and should be emphasized by whichever part is carrying it. I believe the remaining harmonies are somewhat unique among arrangements I have heard.

Written for SATB choir with organ accompaniment.
