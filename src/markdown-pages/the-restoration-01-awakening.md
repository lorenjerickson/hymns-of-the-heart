This is the first of twelve movements from "The Restoration", an oratorio about the
life of the modern day prophet Joseph Smith. On the one hand, It represents the
religious upheaval that Joseph was caught up in during his early teenage years.
On the other hand, it represents the pleading of those beyond the veil waiting
to receive the blessings available through covenants that would be enabled by the
restoration of priesthood authority.

This work is an arrangement the hymn "How Long, O Lord Most Holy and True" found
in the 1985 edition of the hymn book of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints.

Written for SSAATTBB adult choir, SATB youth choir, and string orchestra.
