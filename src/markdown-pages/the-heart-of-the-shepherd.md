This was my submission to the second composing competition sponsored by [Millennial Choirs and Orchestras](https://millennial.org) (MCO) for the Spring 2021 semester. It didn't win. I would guess a some part of that was due to the fact that I had to submit a video of me performing the work. Let's just say that was a little...intimidating.  I'm sure the largest part of that was due to the fact that MCO includes thousands of people across the US and many of those are professional muscians with much more talent that I have. But I like this, nonetheless.  So here it is.

No you can't see the video.

Written for Treble Solo with piano accompaniment.
