An original work that is an interpretive medley of The Lord’s Prayer and O My Father, hymn #282 from the 1985 edition of the hymn book of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

This work guides the listener through three stages or prayer: 1) earnestly seeking a personal communion with the Father of our spirits, even when we may be spiritually distant from Him, 2) sincere expressions for gratitude for every blessing, including His forgiveness, and 3) beseeching His help to avoid transgression so we can one day return to live in His presence.

The key difference, the thing that makes this work personal, is the addendum of the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ to the Lord’s prayer. This is what makes His prayer ours.

Written for SSAATTB choir and orchestra.
