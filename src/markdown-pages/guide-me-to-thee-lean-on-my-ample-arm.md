A medley of hymns #101 and #120 from the 1985 edition of the hymn book of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

I prefer music that reflects life’s realities instead of making everything shiny and beautiful. Each of us are sent here to be tested. To be thrown against opposition and prove our willingness to choose the right. Sometimes we fail. This arrangement glories in the journey and celebrates the opportunity each of us has to return and lean on His ample arm.

This arrangement is a conversation between us and our Savior. Both songs are sung to the tune of Lean on My Ample Arm. The interlude before the last verse represents the struggles of the repentant soul to return to their Savior’s side.

Written for SATB congregation and organ accompaniment.
