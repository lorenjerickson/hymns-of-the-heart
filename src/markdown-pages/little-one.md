I became a grandfather for the first time last month.  I was warned by my parents that it would feel different; that I would feel an overwhelming urge to protect this "little one" from any possible harm.  

They were right.

I've always wondered what these little ones would tell us about if they were born with the ability to speak.  Perhas there's a reason they're not.  Regardless, I felt inspired to write a song about these precious ones "so soon from heaven". 

This was the result.  I wanted it to be about their whole journey, not just these first tender formative years. So each verse is sung by a different voice.  See if you can figure out who they are.  I'll give you a hint: the first one is their mother. 

This is for you Luka, so soon from heaven.
