An arrangement of hymn #194 from the 1985 edition of the hymn book of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

This hymn is characterized by rich harmonies that you donâ€™t typically hear in traditional hymns. I tried to enhance the harmonies already present.

Arranged for SATB a Capella choir.
