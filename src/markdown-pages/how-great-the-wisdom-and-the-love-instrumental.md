When I first paid attention to the fifth verse of this hymn, which we almost never sing, I was struck by how sad it was that the the exclamation point that this verse represents almost never is heard.  "How great, how glorious, how complete, redemption grand design...".  What a great message.  

This arrangement is best presented with strict adherance to tempo and dynamics as marked,  The women reverently ponder the immensity of the sacrifice of his blood and body and plant the seed of what would have happened ("a dying world") if Christ had not come.  It's very important that this verse be sung slowly and very softly.

The men then declare Christ's victory with a slightly faster tempo and brighter sound, and the pattern continues.  

Maintaining balance between the choir and instruments is going to be very critical. 

There are hints of several other hymns sprinkled throughout this arrangement, sometimes not too subtlely.  If you decide to use this music, please let me know what you think.  You feedback is very valuable to me. 

Written for string orchestra, two flutes, and SSAATTBB choir.
