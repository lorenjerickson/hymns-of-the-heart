I don't usually do primary songs.  Most of the time I find them too full of sachhcarine, and with not enough doctrine on their bones.  But with the excitement over the "new music" initialtive announced by the LDS church, I thought I'd try my hand at writing one.  This is now the third, and the one I'm most comfortable sharing here. 

I love songs that tell a complete, doctrinal story; songs that come full circle, if you will.  I'd draw the listeners attention to the fact that "the gift so freely given" is different depending on this verse, and invite you to think about what this teaches our primary children.  

As always, please drop me a line if you have any feedback or suggestions for improvement. 

Written for young voices with piano accompaniment.
