An arrangement of hymn #335 in the 1985 edition of the hymn book of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

I have always loved the tight harmonies in this menâ€™s hymn. I wanted an arrangement that started simple, rather than giving away all the goodness up front. This is the result.

Arranged for TTBB a Capella choir.
