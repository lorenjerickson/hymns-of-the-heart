Songs that represent essential spiritual transformations are wonderful.  The first verses of this favorite hymn ask a lot of questions.  The last verse gives the one, indeed the only, answer to all of them: turn to the Savior.  Written for SAATBB, but can be adapted to other 6-part ensembles as needed.  

Written for SSAATTBB choir with piano accompaniment.
