While working on The Restoration, a cantata about the life of Joseph Smith, I spent a lot of time looking for a hymn that represented the religious upheaval at that time.  I eventually found How Long, Oh Lord Most Holy and True.  While not strictly about Joseph or the history of his time, this hymn perfectly embodies the heart of the humble soul who is seeking divine grace from the Savior, and therefore was a perfect backdrop for that first movement of The Restoration, titled "Awakening".

I wanted to make that arrangement accessible to ward and stake choirs, so I adapted the orchestral arrangement to this SSATB and Organ arrangement.  The first two verses deliberately depict a dark and discouraging scene, speaking of "shadowed hope" and "prison doors".  But I wanted the last verse to represent the realization of the promised blessings of salvation, so it transitions to a major key to allow the choir to proclaim "swing wide the gates and set us free!"  Perhaps those gates are the ones that lead to heaven.  

As always, if you stumble across this and have an opinion please drop me a note.  I value your feedback. 

Written for SSAATTBB choir with organ accompaniment.
