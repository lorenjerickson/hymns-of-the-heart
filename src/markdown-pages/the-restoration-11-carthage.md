While being jailed in Carthage, Missouri, Joseph Smith asked John Taylor to sing a favorite hymn, "A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief" to ease his troubled heart. This composition is a medley of that hymn and "I Need Thee Every Hour". It graphically depicts a mob storming the jail, and firing into the room where Joseph, his brother Hyrum, and John Taylor were confined. Hyrum was struck four times and died within that room. Joseph, after being struck himself, attempted to escape through a window, exclaiming "Oh Lord, my God!", and fell to the ground below where he was struck several more times and died. John Taylor remarkably survived the assault and later served as President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
