An a capella arrangement of this beloved classic.  So easy to get this wrong with this being a favorite hymn of so many.  Hopefully I haven't fallen to far off the mark.  This arrangement has a few unusual qualities.  It's a capella, and the altos and basses share the melody.  Nary a melody note is sung by the sopranos or tenors.  Sorry.  You'll probably find it to be one of the more unusual arrangements out there.

As always, please drop me a note if you have feedback about this arrangement.  

Written for a Capella mixed choir.
