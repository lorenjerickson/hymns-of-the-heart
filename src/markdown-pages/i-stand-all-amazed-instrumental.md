This is an instrumental arrangement of I Stand All Amazed.  It calls for Flute and string quartet (violin, viola, cello bass).  I arranged this for a stake conference some time ago, and it was well received.  Perhaps someone here can make use of it.  

As always, please provide feedback if you listen or use this work.  I would love to hear what you think. 

Written for string quartet and flute.
